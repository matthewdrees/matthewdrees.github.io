By Jessie Inchauspé.

We want to avoid glucose spikes, which will make us feel better. We do this by preferring foods high in fiber over "processed" foods.

Glucose spikes from sugar are worse than those from starch because of extra fructose. Glucose gets stored in muscles and liver, then fat. Fructose goes straight to fat.

The book starts out with a small chemistry lesson in how starch gets converted into glucose.

Hacks to "flatten the curve":
* Order of eating: fiber, protein/fat, then starch.
* Add a green starter to all of your meals.
* Don't count calories.
* Try to win breakfast.

Probably didn't need a full book. Could have done it in 5-10 pages.
