By Megan Rapinoe.

My family got this book for me as a Christmas gift. I've been a big Megan Rapinoe fan since her epic cross to Abby Wambach in the 2011 World Cup. I consider Megan and Sue Bird to be Seattle's preeminent power couple. (Russell and Ciara are a close second.)

This was a fun, fast read! She got me laughing on the first page where she admits she is "totally" cashing in with this book. She self-admits she doesn't think about how something will land before she says or does it. It gives the book a raw, honest feel.

There are some tough themes in this book. She didn't realize she was gay until college. Her brother Brian is dealing with an opioid addiction. She had a few tough relationship break ups... in all cases I feel more sorry for the other person, but good for Megan to be honest about. She had a tough relationship with coach Jill on the US Women's National Team. I bet these kinds of things happen a lot more often than we know.

She's become an advocate for many issues: rights and acceptance for LGBTQ and minority communities, and equal pay for women in sports. She took a knee during the national anthem in soccer games that caused here to lose playing time. She was able to come back to the team, but Colin Kaepernick never did. She suggests that is less threatening for a small, cute, white woman to be vocal about these kinds of things.

She asks if we can we spend just 5 minutes a day thinking of a way to make the world better? LFG! (Let's go!)
