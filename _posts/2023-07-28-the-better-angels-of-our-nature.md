By Steven Pinker.

Christmas gift. 700 pages of small print can be summed up neatly by the subtitle of the book: Violence has declined. There are a lot of interesting nuggets and turns of phrase in this book, but there really could be more editorial restraint.

# 1. A Foreign Country
The past was violent. Full of gory examples of how terrible us humans are to each other throughout most of history. Reminded me of Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast.

# 2. The Pacification Process
* The logic of violence. Hobbes and Darwin philosophies on society.
* Violence in human ancestors. Groups of chimpanzees will kill solitary chimpanzees in neighboring territory.
* Kinds of human societies.
* Rates of violence in state and nonstate societies. Good charts. State societies are less violent than nonstate. Unsurprising.
* Civilization and its Discontents.

# 3. The Civilizing Process
* Why is it rude to use your knife to help guide food onto your fork while eating? *Aha* moment halfway through the chapter but spoiler: etiquette has evolved to prevent people from stabbing each other at the table.
* European homicide decline. Norbert Elias wrote *The Civilizing Process* in 1939, showed a shocking 100-fold decline in violence from 13 to 20th centuries, and inspired the author to write this book. Men are responsible for 92% of killings.
* Explaining the European homicide decline.
* Violence and class.
* Violence around the world.
* Violence in the United States.
* Decivilization in the 1960s.
* Recivilization in the 1990s.
