By Paul Hudson.

Paul recommends the [https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui](100 Days of SwiftUI) course over the [https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100](100 Days of Swift) course, but I've run into limitations of SwiftUI and find myself needing to understand the UIKit & Interface Builder stuff.

I like the pacing of this course. Paul is right when he says a little bit each day.

1. 10 mins. Skimmed it. Swift is type safe. Type is inferred but can be specific with annotations. Use let/var syntax to allow for constants (rather than extra "const" keyword in C++). The multi-line string """ formatting is strict.
2. Arrays are the main thing. Like Vectors in C++, Lists in Python, or Vec in Rust. Sets and Dictionaries are Hash Tables. Tuples are fixed size and type but the values are mutable. Enumerations are variants like in Rust (I think).
16. A lot of ground covered on this one. Interface Builder, storyboards, Swift. I remember how much I dislike storyboards. It took a little bit longer than an hour... Using "aspectFill" caused the image to go up into the Navigation title area, I managed to fix it but not confident in the fix. I really like how Paul talks through the code, especially points where the code can fail with possible errors. A very good intro to Interface Builder.
