Washington State resource for talking to kids about alcohol and marijuana.

Of the resources listed on the Lincoln High School website, this was the best.
It has some [really good parent resources](https://starttalkingnow.org/parents).

I also found the [Healthy Youth Survey](https://www.askhys.net/SurveyResults/DataDashboard) very interesting.

* Yearly survey of washington state kids.
* Percent of 10th graders that had a any alcohol in the last month, by King county and WA state, is down from ~27% in 2010 to 7-9% in 2023.
* 12th graders is higher: 40% in 2010 down to ~18% in 2023.

# Notes for family discussion

* Safety first:
  * Don't be in a car where the driver has had any alcohol.
  * Make sure everyone gets home safe, especially women.
  * We  will come and get you if you or your friends are in trouble, no questions asked.
  * Be careful in large groups with people you don't know.
* Be honest when talking about where you are going, who you are with, and if alcohol will be served. We can talk through it.
* Tactics when alcohol is offered.
  * Ask about non-alcoholic options.
  * Just don't drink much of it.
  * Say no.
* Erica Barnett's [book on dealing with her alcoholism]({% post_url 2020-11-07-quitter-a-memior-of-drinking-relapse-and-recovery %}) suggested no more than 1 drink per hour, 2 drinks per day, and 4 in a week.
* Recent studies suggest that [no amount of alcohol is good for you](https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health).
* Know how much alcohol in each drink:
  * lager beer: ~5%
  * craft beers can be much higher: 6-7%
  * wine: 12%
  * hard alcohol: 40%
* Stats:
  * 8% of 10th graders in king county said they had alcohol in the past month.
  * 17% of 12 graders in Washington STate said they had alcohol in the past month.
  * These numbers are declining.
  * 52% of adults in USA had a drink the last month.

Another good resource listed by the Lincoln High School.

* Drinking alcohol isn't "normal".
* Many are coerced into trying it to fit in, socialize, deal with life transitions, or deal with emotional pain.
* Advice for parents (see link)

<https://drugfree.org/article/teen-brain-development/>

* Teens brains aren't developed yet.
* Alcohol can feel good in the moment. Teens "have an over-active impulse to seek pleasure and less ability to consider the consequences".

<https://drugfree.org/article/healthy-risk-taking/>

* Risk taking can be a good thing. It can help us figure out who we are.
* Identify "healthy risks" to take. Things that spark joy.

* Reiterates above points (risk factors & parent tips)

# USA alcohol stats

Underage alcohol stats from the [National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/underage-drinking)
* In the past month, about 14% of underage kids had consumed alcohol
* Underage kids drink less often than adults, but when they do they're more likely to binge drink.
* Ages 16-17: fewer than 1 in 5 reported drinking, fewer than 1 in 10 reported binge-drinking.

Alcohol stats for USA aged 18 and older from the [CDC stats on alcohol use](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm)
* 52% of adults aged 18 and older at least 12 drinks in past year.
* 25% of adults 18 and older at least 1 "heave drinking day" (5 or more drinks for men, 4 for women) in the past year.
