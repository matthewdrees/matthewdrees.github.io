By Robin Wall Kimmerer.

This book has floated around the house for a bit, and is currently [222 weeks on the NYTimes best seller paperback nonfiction list](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/).

Scoring:
* Axe for the frozen sea: 7/10.
* Page count: 384. Effective page count depended on the chapter, some were breathtakingly fast, some really slow.

The book is a collection of essays covering what the book subtitle suggests: "Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants".

The prose was brilliant, though it was ocassionally was too flowery for my taste.

Each chapter hit a different way. I greatly enjoyed a few of them, generally enjoyed most of them, but skipped along with a few of them. Maybe in the future with "essay collection" books I'll track that.

Plants have a lot to teach us if we pay attention. The author got a PhD in botany, but then discovered there was a lot to learn from Indigenous Wisdom.

Only harvest half of what's available in the wild at a given spot. Some plants (sweetgrass) depend on harvests. Grasses depend on animals eating them.

I'm just now learning about the "three sisters" in American agriculture technique: corn, beans, and squash. They help each other grow and keep the soil rich in nitrogen. You can mix the types of each to get variety. I learned the Aztecs were doing this as well on our recent trip to Mexico.

My favorite story was the author's quest to turn the spring-fed pond on her farm from a mucky green slimy mess into a clear blue pond because she and her daughters wanted to swim in it. She pulled the plants that grew in the pond, let them dry for a day or so, then hauled them out of the watershed. She did it with spare bits of time she had from being a professor and a single mom. It took a couple of decades (the kids were out of the house by then), but she did it. I enjoy hearing about personal quests like this! What is the pond-clearing job in my life? Hmmm.

Onandaga Lake had a century of raw sewage and industrial dumping and is a superfund site. At some point people had to make decisions like "where should we dump this industrial waste?" and dumped it in the lake. [Onandaga Lake cleanup plan](http://www.lakecleanup.com/about-the-cleanup/) dredged and capped the contaminants for $500 million, though [Onandaga Nation wasn't completely satisfied](https://www.onondaganation.org/land-rights/the-onondaga-lake-cleanup-plan/) and had their own $2 billion plan. Lesson learned: an ounce of prevention is woth a pound of cure. Good news: the plants and wildlife are starting to reclaim the lake, and the water is cleaner than it has been in 100 years.

Bottom line: this book that should be on everyone's reading list, but you can skip the chapters that don't spark joy.
