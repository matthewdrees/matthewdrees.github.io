I heard about Denis Bakhvalov's [Performance Ninja Class](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja) on a recent episode of [cppcast](https://cppcast.com/performance-tuning/).

## Warmup lab

It took a little bit of work to get [perf running on WSL2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60237123/is-there-any-method-to-run-perf-under-wsl).
