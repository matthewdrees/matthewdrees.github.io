By Leigh Bardugo.

I read this book because everyone else in my family read it.

This is the first in the [Shadow and Bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_and_Bone) trilogy. I'm told if you want to understand the Netflix TV series you should also read the [Six of Crows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_of_Crows) duology first as well because it mashes them together.

Unfortunately I'm only getting around to writing notes on this 3 months after I actually read it so the details are hazy. The story is about Alina, a 17 year old raised in an orphanage. (Spoiler) She discovers she ia a Sun Summoner, with a rare power to fix the dreaded Shadow Fold in the middle of the land. The book isn't very long, has large font, and the story moves along at a riveting pace, has some great plot twists, and finishes with a satisfying ending. No wonder that it's a popular book! Recommended.

Money quote: "Be careful of powerful men", Genya's prescient warning to Alina.
