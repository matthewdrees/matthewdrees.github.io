Seattle started the Democracy Voucher Program in 2017 [^2]. I thought it was a clever idea at the time, but I'm only now getting around to actually participating in it.

It's a lot bigger ask than voting. I think it's worth doing... you become a more informed citizen and it's a clever idea to get the money out of politics.

# Notes
* Seattle registered voters get 4 x $25 vouchers to give to candidates.
* You get the vouchers in February, then have until November to submit them.
* In 2021 there are 4 positions available for vouchers: Mayor, City Council positions 8 & 9, and City Attorney.
* This program is funded by a $3 million/year property tax[^1]. (About $8 per household [^3].)
* With ~492k registered voters [^5], that's enough money for 6% of registered voters.
* Unused voucher money is carried forward to the next year, enough so that $6.8 million is available for 2021 [^1] (14% of registered voters). For details see the Budget Summary Report on the [2019 Biennial Report](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/EthicsElections/DemocracyVoucher/2019_Biennial_Report(0).pdf).
* As of May 30, ~18k people have submitted their vouchers for 2021 [^4]. (3.7% of registered voters.)
* In 2019, ~38k voters submitted their vouchers [^6]. (7% of registered voters.)
* The names of everyone who submits a voucher and the candidate they submit it to are available in a *.csv file on the program data page [^4]. I looked around but didn't recognize anyone I know. :-)
* There are $ limits per position... Mayor: $800k, City Council: $375k, City Attorney: $475k [^3].
* There is a terrific [FAQ](http://www.seattle.gov/democracyvoucher/i-am-a-seattle-resident) to know more.

# Strategy to getting it done
1. Read the [Candidate Introductions](http://www.seattle.gov/democracyvoucher/i-am-a-seattle-resident/candidate-introductions) document. At the time of this writing there are 16 candidates with write-ups, one page each, combined for all 4 positions. Very doable. There are more candidates, so this is a nice filter.
2. Optionally you can do some follow up research on candidates. I did this for a handful of them. In hindsight I had better things to do. Just shoot from the hip.
3. Don't mail these things anywhere! Create an account on the [Online Portal](http://www.seattle.gov/democracyvoucher/i-am-a-seattle-resident/online-portal). It's easy to submit vouchers from there. Once you sign up they will email you vouchers in the future instead of mailing them [^6].

Looking through the Voucher Program Data.csv file it looks like most people submitted all 4 vouchers for the same candidate. I sprinkled mine around a bit.

You probably want to do this earlier rather than later. It might help a candidate with viability and/or the money might run out.

Otherwise just recycle the vouchers and trust that 6% of your fellow registered voters will get the job done. :-)
