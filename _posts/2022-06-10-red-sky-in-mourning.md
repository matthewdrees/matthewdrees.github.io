By Tami Oldham Ashcraft.

Got this book from my sister a year ago. I took it with me to the Swiftsure sailing race over Memorial Day weekend.

In 1983, the author survived 41 days adrift on the 44' Ketch sailboat *Hazana*. They were caught under sail in [Hurricane Raymod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Pacific_hurricane_season#Hurricane_Raymond) and her fiance Richard Sharp was swept overboard and the ship was de-masted. The author jury-rigged a sail and dead-reckoned a route to Hawaii at 2 knots.

The life Tami lived in her young 20s sounded like so much fun. She drove her van to the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula, surfed for a bit, then crewed for sail boats around the Pacific. *Why haven't any of the rest of us thought of this?*

My favorite character was the voice in her head. *You're just saying that.* No, really!

The Hazana was restored and is [currently at Waikiki Yacht Harbor](https://www.kauai-hawaii.com/what-happened-to-the-hazana-boat-after-arriving-in-hawaii/).

The author now lives on San Juan Island. She talks about the joy of hiking up Young Hill, which brought a smile to my face because we just did that same hike a few weeks ago!

Quick read. Highly recommended!
