One of my goals for the year was to run a 5k while averaging 8 minute miles. I met it today after 16 weeks of training with a final time of 24:43. Seven seconds to spare!

All organized 5k runs were cancelled this year due to COVID-19, so I made up my own route from the Ballard Fred Meyer to the Ballard Locks parking lot and back. (No traffic disruptions and no other joggers around so I don't need to wear a mask.) I measured the time and distance with my Garmin watch.

For a workout plan I used the running part of the "sprint" plan from "The Triathlon Training Book" (James Beckinsale).
I also took some tips, including measuring my daily "Diet Quality Score" (DQS), from [Racing Weight]({% post_url 2020-08-06-racing-weight %}).

### 5k trial runs
I ran a 5k every 4 weeks to measure progress:

| Date       | Time  | Notes |
|:----------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 2020-07-31 | 32:23 | 10:45 min/mile (My garmin watch told me I needed "4 days" of recovery time. Haha.) |
| 2020-08-29 | 29:27 | 9:26 min/mile |
| 2020-09-23 | 27:00 | 8:42 min/mile |
| 2020-10-21 | 25:38 | 8:16 min/mile |
| 2020-11-18 | 24:43 | 7:57 min/mile, goal achieved! |


### Takeaways
* Training by alternating hard/medium/easy runs really seemed to work!
* Run without headphones. It's easier to work on technique, and it feels better.
* Do the "warm up" and "cool down" routines described in the Beckinsale book.
* It didn't feel good to run more than 3 times a week, so I mixed in some bike rides instead.
* My weight and body fat percentage stayed mostly the same, which was interesting.
