Retrospective from our solar panel installation from 18 months ago (May, 2022).

Bottom line: We're getting a 5.0% return on investment at the moment. This will go up to 5.3% next year with [SCL's planned 9.5% rate hikes](https://powerlines.seattle.gov/2023/10/12/2024-rate-surcharges/#:~:text=Seattle%20City%20Light%20will%20implement,Administration%20(BPA)%20in%202024)

## Solar Installation Notes

* Final total cost: $14,227
  * $20,325 initial cost, minus a $6,098 [federal tax credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/residential-clean-energy-credit) (FYI this 30% tax credit is available for installs in 2022 - 2032).
* Size: 6.09 kW.
* 14 x SPR-M435-WHT-AC panels, west-facing.
* Warranty: 25 years, 92% effective at year 25.
* No sales tax in WA.
* 3 bids, all were same price/watt.

## SCL bills for 3 years

Solar panels installed in May 2022. Numbers are from SCL, billed every other month. Note the consumption is negative when we generate more solar that we use and electricity goes back to the grid and we carry a balance. The balance is cleared to zero at the start of every April but we haven't had a full April to April year yet.

## Monthly solar data from our EV meter

Part of the installation was a meter that tracks the amount of solar produced, electricity consumed, and net export to the grid. Here are data from all complete months.
