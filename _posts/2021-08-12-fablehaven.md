By Brandon Mull.

Fablehaven is this first in a 5 book series in the fantasy genre for children. Everyone else in my family has read it and I didn't want to be left out of the conversation.

I've read a few of these types of books now (Percy Jackson, The Golden Compass, Miss Peregrin's Home for Peculiar Children, Space Case) and there is definitely an emerging pattern. There is a problem to be solved, preferably caused by a evil power that could end the world as we know it, and the kids figure it out and save the day. The adults in the story are too ignorant of the problem to be useful. Having said that, each of these books were fun to read and this was no exception.

Kendra (13 years old) and her younger brother Seth (11) are sent to their grandparents' home for a couple weeks in the summer. They find out that the grandparents are managing a large property called Fablehaven that is filled with magical creatures. Adventure ensues. Several times in the story adults warn the kids to not do something, and it was breathtaking how quickly Seth would do that thing *every time*. I get that you need to want to know the reason why not to do something but Seth is just reckless. Luckily Kendra is there for balance. My main takeaway: be sure your attic windows can be securely fastened. ;-)

I will definitely read the next book in the Fablehaven series, but I didn't make it all the way to Percy Jackson 5. We'll see how it goes.
