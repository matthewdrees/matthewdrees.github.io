On Amazon it has [5 stars on >64k reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Oathbringer-Book-Three-Stormlight-Archive/dp/1250297141/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.35pjkpPCmlzbvBe_ytHqgetF5yPms9SoInQmFcIkmUalHS6ZXEoT5t9KDRA2QRbiafWMrqFN6sy0NJOcLkRqc8J_c8BNR6Okc4dGy6qQHMAn2IJ3m-7yf0uoHN_IKc90VAtov-YIGOOmQABCXt3Dpzi6Jv599u56bKpLiP0SP--OYlgV84IM2_b4GVi7zj7gDJfuqSHFUzWJaWep4Xiczje2ch_BFHLGFnGXJexx0NU.XnGB-4224x-mEF4vKaSMEoDhWhLUk38_5FxZLWRpBxY&qid=1729787917&sr=8-1)

My notes on first 2 books:
* [The Way of Kings]({% post_url 2022-02-08-the-way-of-kings %}).
* [Words of Radiance]({% post_url 2022-08-26-words-of-radiance %}).

Scoring:
* Axe for the frozen sea: 9/10.
* Page count: 1300. With small print, it felt like 1300.

Book 3 and I'm still surging with stormlight! These books are a fun way to "pass the time" because they do take a long time for me to read. Usually I want to be done with a book quickly so I can cross it off the list but it was fun to savor this one.

After the first 2 books I was wondering if this series would challange Lord of the Rings for greatest fantasy series of all time. Nope! This series wanders a bit like a soap opera. It's really good though.

All 3 books follow the same pacing for me... halfway through it's a little sluggish and I'm tempted to stop (in fact, I did take a 5 month break in the middle of this book), but the second half builds nicely to a mighty battle.

Random thoughts: (has spoilers!)
* The mystery of Dalinar's memory is explained, uncovering how Eli died.
* I think it's Jasnah on the front cover? (I feel a bit dumb for not being totally sure.)
* Szeth jumping over to the side of the good guys was fun but a bit jarring. He's too good of a character to be done with. Hopefully there is a future highly-entertaining group conversation with him, Shallan, Kaladin, Adolin, and Wit, similar to the coversation in the horse-drawn wagon in book 2.
* Speaking of which.... how did Dalinar not flinch when Szeth showed up?
* Kaladin has troubles "speaking the words" in his final fight to distract the Fused, but I thought he already spoke them in book 2? Did he regress? Does he have to follow the same 5 step plan the Szeth has to follow? He's already bonded a highspren, so he should be on step 4: completing a quest to his spren's satisfaction (which likely has to do with accepting help from others). (And you *know* Szeth is going to be the one to complete step 5 for a total redemption of truthless.)
* The latest big hurricanes we've had (Helene & Milton) make me think of the new everstorms in this book.
* Why do the Fused retreat in the end? They seem strong enough to win battles on their own, and if they die they can simply rebond with another Parshendi a short while later. Poor strategy.
* Oathbringer is a cool name for a book, but the namesake sword didn't really have a main part? Amaram wielded it in the fight against Kaladin, and it ends up in Dalinar's possession at the end.
* Jasnah and Adolin are both good choices for King.

Unresolved questions:
* Does Vinli totally jump ship and become a Radiant herself?
* Will Dalinar find out the truth about Taravangian?
* Will Shallan really marry Adolin? Come on Veil! I expect more tension with Kalandin. Though the real power couple would be Kalandin and Jasnah. (Jasnah, whose jedi-like power growth through this book was exceptional.) Unlikely though. They would win the most votes for "least likely to be in a relationship".
* What's the deal with Wit? (Ultimately the reason I will keep reading these books. Don't dissapoint on this Brandon!)
