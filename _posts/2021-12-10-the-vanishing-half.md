By Brit Bennett.

I don't remember the recommendation or reason why I put this on my library queue, though I'm glad I did. I knew nothing about this book before opening the cover but I had just finished Trevor Noah's book [Born a Crime]({% post_url 2021-10-13-born-a-crime %}) and this is a nice complement.

The story is about twin girls born in a small Southern town. They are born to a white mother and Black father, and are very light in complexion, light enough to pass as being "white". They choose different paths in life, and the book becomes a page-turner about a third of the way with a big plot twist. It has the feel of a thriller but instead of a killer on the loose you wonder "will they ever find this person?" and "will they be honest with the other person?" (worded vaguely so no spoilers). The books ends with two of the main characters enjoying being around each other while swimming secluded at a lake, and my takeaway from the scene, and the book as a whole, is you are likelier to find happiness by being honest with yourself and others.

I've come around to enjoying reading fiction because of books like this. The story plausibly could have happened in real life, and gave me some new perspective. Highly recommended.
