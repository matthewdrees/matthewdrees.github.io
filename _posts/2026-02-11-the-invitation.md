By A.M. Castle.

I'm not sure how I ended up with this book? I thought it came recommended by a family member but now everyone denies it.

Some people are invited to a party on small island off the coast of England. There are some murders. Who did it? There is bad weather and a high tide so nobody can leave.

The point of view of the story alternates between people each chapter (Gita, Vicky, Tom, etc), which you don't often see. I imagine Gwyneth Paltrow playing the roll of Rachel.

The last 50-100 pages read quickly, which I like, and there is a decent amount of escapism, also good, but otherwise this book shouldn't be on any must-read lists.
