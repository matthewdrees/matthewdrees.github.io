By Martha Wells.

The first of currently 6 books in [The Murderbot Diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries) series. I picked up a copy from the library based on a [Seattle Times book recommendation](https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/20-summer-book-recommendations-from-your-favorite-seattle-and-wa-authors/).

The book is remarkably small: only 150 pages, which caused many thoughts and emotions:
1. Whew, it won't take long to notch another book on my list!
2. Was picking up this book even worth my time?
3. What does this say about the reading ability of our generation? How can we tolerate such a modest effort on the part of Ms. Wells?
4. Ms. Wells is a business genius. Make fun/fast books for the masses and then profit! Google for "martha wells net worth" and google says $5 million! Maybe I could write a short story and sell it... Hmmm...

The setting is a futuristic world where a team of people are on another planet with a rented Murderbot. The Murderbot looks like a human and has many human-like qualities. The plot is simple but that's not the point. It's laugh-out-loud funny in many places.

Sure enough, it's a fun and fast read. But I can't say that this book makes the cut for recommendations. Of the similar fiction I've read recently -- which is more for young adult, but I'm going for overall enjoyment here -- I would put it alongside Percy Jackson and [Space Case](./2021-06-09-space-case.md), and would instead recommend [Fablehaven](./2021-08-12-fablehaven.md), [The Golden Compass](./2020-07-11-the-golden-compass.md), and [Miss Peregrin's Home for Peculiar Children](./2020-12-16-miss-peregrins-home-for-peculiar-children.md). Having said that, my neighbor *loved* this series so I'll be tempted to try the second book.
