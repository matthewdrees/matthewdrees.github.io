By Stuart Gibbs.

I prefer to read nonfiction, but when my fiction stack was empty I asked around for a recommendation. My daughter put this book in my hands.

I can see why. It's a fun book! Dashiel is a 12 year old living on Moon Base Alpha in 2040. It's the first attempt at humans living away from earth. A compelling murder mystery ensues. Not a spoiler: I thought Zan did it. Not saying what actually happened.

My son would call this book "candy" and I agree. There are several more books in this series. I probably won't read them, but I enjoyed the sweet taste of this one.
