I was on my way to independently inventing this system. After describing it to my sister's boyfriend Christian, he said "Oh, have you heard of Bullet Journaling?" I had not, so picked up a copy of the book to figure out what I was missing out on.

The fundamenentals:
 - Get a journal. My current one is 8.25" x 6" and works well for me.
 - Collections (pages dedicated to a topic) are tracked in the front index. Number the pages as you go. Suggested collections in the book:
   - Index
   - Monthly log. A record of what you did (not a plan of what you will do), good for retrospectives.
   - Future log. A place to put future tasks.
   - Goals
   - Reading list
   - 28 easy things to do to make things better, so simple you will actually do them (1 each day for 28 day).
   - Gratitude log
 - Daily logs for todo lists and notes, not tracked in the index.
 - Use "rapid logging":  
   ⋅ task  
   o event  
   \- note  
   \* ⋅ task with signifier  
   ~~Never gonna do it~~  
   \> Copy task forward  
   < Migrate to future log  
   X Task complete  
 - Reflections:
   - PM reflection: A time to review. Count your wins.
   - AM reflection: A time to plan.
   - Monthly reflection. Migrate tasks forward. Ask: Is this worth my while? What would happen if this task didn't happen?
   - Yearly reflection. Start a new journal each year, regardless of progress.
 - Live an intentional life. Stay curious. Get in the zone.

That gets you 80% of the way. You can pick up a few extra tips and tricks by reading the book. It's a quick read, and very skimmable in parts. I've read a few self-help books now, and I'm noticing similar, repeated advice from book to book. A good rule of thumb is probably not to read more than one self-help book per year, and have a lifetime cap in the single digits.

Bullet Journal Method seems like a clever plan. I'm going to try it for a while and see how it goes!
