By Robin R. Meyers.

Religion hasn't changed much in the past several thousand years, but the world has changed dramatically. Why should we believe stories like Genesis when science tells us the Big Bang is likely how the universe began? Particiaption in all religions across the world are declining.

We shouldn't think about God as an "old man in the sky". We should look around instead of up. Several mentions about the Luminous Web, I need to look into that.

My favorite parts of the book are those that weaved in experiences as a minister. They don't teach you everything at seminary school. I enjoyed the writing style.
